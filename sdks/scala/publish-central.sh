# Upload the signed bundle `sbt publishSigned` staged to Maven Central, through
# the Central Portal's publisher API.
#
# Why this exists rather than `sbt sonatypeBundleRelease`: sbt-sonatype (3.12.2,
# the newest) speaks the legacy Nexus staging API. The Portal does not serve it
# — `https://central.sonatype.com/service/local/...` returns a 404 HTML page —
# and Sonatype's compatibility host implements only part of it, so the release
# path dies on
#
#   400 Bad Request: Endpoint /service/local/staging/profile_repositories
#                    not supported
#
# The Portal's own API takes the whole bundle as one zip, which is exactly what
# is already staged. No plugin in between, so nothing here breaks when the next
# one changes.
#
# Credentials come from a Central Portal **user token** (central.sonatype.com ->
# your account -> Generate User Token), via the environment:
#
#   CENTRAL_TOKEN_USERNAME, CENTRAL_TOKEN_PASSWORD
#
# Usage:
#   sbt publishSigned && ./publish-central.sh
#   PUBLISHING_TYPE=AUTOMATIC ./publish-central.sh   # release without the portal UI step
