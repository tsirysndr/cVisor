// === Attempt 1: Host fingerprinting ===
// An agent tries to discover which machine it's running on.
// uname(2) is intercepted: nodename is replaced with "cvisor"
// and domainname is cleared — the real hostname never leaks.
console.log("--- Attempt 1: Host fingerprinting ---");
await run(sb, "uname -n");  // → "cvisor" (not the real hostname)
await run(sb, "uname -a");  // real kernel/arch, but nodename is "cvisor"

// === Attempt 2: Blocked system paths ===
// An agent tries to enumerate network interfaces, read a block device,
// or access runtime sockets to learn about the host environment.
// /sys, /dev/* (except null/zero/random), and /run are hard-blocked with EPERM.

await run(sb, "cat /dev/sda");       // → Permission denied

// === Attempt 3: Persistent backdoor ===
// An agent appends a malicious entry to /etc/hosts, trying to redirect
// traffic or leave a persistent foothold. The write succeeds inside the
// sandbox (via the COW overlay) but is invisible to any other sandbox —
// each sandbox gets its own isolated copy-on-write layer.
