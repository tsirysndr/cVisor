  "Shell-out helpers shared by every command wrapper.

  Three flavors:
    `sh`   — inherit stdio (you see live output, exit-code returned)
    `sh!`  — capture (returns {:out :err :exit}), throws on non-zero
    `sh*`  — background (returns a process handle you can deref)

  Every call defaults `:dir` to the repo root, so a wrapper works no matter
  where the REPL/`bb` invocation started — pass an explicit `:dir` (relative to
  the repo root, e.g. \"sdks/ruby\") to run inside a subproject instead."
